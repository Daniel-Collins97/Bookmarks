# Bookmarking

This Project is based on a Bookmarking application, which allows the user to create a profile and store collections of bookmarks within the application

### Prerequisites

For this project, I used the "[Glitch](https://glitch.com/)" platform, which allowed me to write the programme and display a live version of the project on a webpage.

### The Project Contents

This Project allowed to work with the Front and Back end of a Web Page for the first time. We were introduced to "Controllers", "Models", "Partial Views", and "Full Views". This enabled me to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON all in the same Project.
The Porject gives the user an option to "Sign Up" or "Log In", which creates an acount for the user. The user is then able to make a collection, and within that collection, is able to store multiple "Bookmarks" (URL's for Web Pages). It also allows the user to give the Bookmark a custom name and description.
There are multiple CRUD implementations in this project, including the following;
- Adding a User
- Storing the Users Log In credentials
- Adding a Collection
- Adding a Bookmark to a Collection
- Removing Collections
- Removing Bookmarks
